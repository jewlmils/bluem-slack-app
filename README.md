# Bluem (Slack App Clone)

Bluem is a Vite + React project, emulating Slack and built with Avion School's Slack API. Designed for educational purposes, this application replicates Slack's functionalities, offering a customized communication platform with a familiar interface.

Problem: Unable to fetch API in Vercel.
Solution: Click on the padlock icon, go to settings, navigate to insecure content, allow it, then reload. Now, you should be able to use the API fetch as intended :)
